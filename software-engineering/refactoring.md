## Preface

> Refactoring is the process of changing a software system in a way that does not alter the external behavior of the code yet improves its internal structure. It is a disciplined way to clean up code that minimizes the chances of introducing bugs . In essense, when you refactor, you are improving the design of the code after it has been written.
